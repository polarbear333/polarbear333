# Hi there, I'm Matthew Chan 👋

## About Me
I'm a student at UC Santa Barbara with a strong interest of  deep reinforcement learning, control theory, and scalable ML systems. I'm interested in learning about the design of intelligent autonomous systems as well as the infrastructure needed to deploy them in productions. Aside from academic interests, I'm also motivated to innovate and create effective solutions, both for the open source community through collaborative development, and for real-world business challenges with data-driven approaches.

🔭 **Research Interests:**
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning** for autonomous systems and robotics
- **Data-Driven Control** methods that combine classical control theory with modern machine learning
- **MLOps** and infrastructure for deploying production-grade machine learning systems
- **ML Algorithms and Natural Language Processing** for building intelligent information retrieval systems

🌱 **Currently exploring:**
- Advanced RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, SAC) for robotic control tasks
- Scalable infrastructure for training and deploying ML models
- Bridging the gap between simulation and real-world deployment
- Integration of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) with data-driven models for improved prediction of complex systems.
